Today was fun! I was very nervous when it came to talking about myself (as per usual), but practiced my personal pitch a fair amount and delivered it relatively seamlessly. When it came to talking about the project, or fielding questions, I felt no discomfort which was very interesting. I have little experience in public speaking, and have wanted to move into this realm for a while but ran into massive blocks of discomfort but this forced me to identify where that discomfort lies - not in public speaking itself, but in speaking ABOUT myself. I have found a new confidence in speaking about material that I do not personally identify with, as it was surprisingly natural and I intend to explore this with my peers in the future and with subjects I have great interest in hosting public exploration of.
