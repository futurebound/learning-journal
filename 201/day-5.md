Today I found out I really suck with GitHub.

I have no idea what I'm doing and have been stuck for an obscene amount of time on how to properly fork and clone the repo for the functions lab, then branch for each problem, merge that branch into master on GitHub (is the fork of the repo the master??) and immediately pull the merged master back onto my machine before branching again.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, because I was able to complete this successfully for the first problem, but by following the same protocol for the second branch, it's not showing up in the master on GitHub.

I'll be restarting from scratch this weekend after going through some tutorials on the matter, and will be in touch with the class slack/TAs if I really can't get it done. I have no problem with the functions, but the branching and merging process is so alien to me.
