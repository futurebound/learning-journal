Today was also great! We got our MVP working with a stretch goal implemented, which allows for randomization of notecards as well as the flip animation functioning. My team spent a fair amount of time styling everything to get it to this point, and I put my head down and wrote out the JS for it and modified the banks of flashcards slightly to keep it from breaking.

We also began working on a quiz format, and got all the questions finished for short quizzes with a scoring system as another stretch goal, and with the styling already implemented it should be simple to bring quiz pages up to speed.

Another few stretch goals are to add in resource pages, more flashcards, and cheatsheets along with a chart for the quizzes. All of these are thankfully unnecessary for the MVP version of this project, but we are at a place that we can prioritize and implement whichever we choose as we polish the MVP with the time we have tomorrow.
