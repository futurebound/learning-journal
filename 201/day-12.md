Enjoyed today. I finally was able to work through (with assistance, but not explicit guidance) a bunch of my issues related to pictures not posting to the page, and have a MUCH better understanding of how to identify HTML elements in JS and modify them as needed.

Jeremy sent me a code snippet of a for loop that he used to identity whether the src of something being clicked on through an event listener, and from there I was able to construct my own event listeners and code the turned them on/off, and modified the src of the pictures on the page to then get their selected/picked counter working properly.

Honestly it just felt good to not be more than one day behind when I left campus.
