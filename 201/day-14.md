We got our groups today, and had a pretty wonderful time identifying where everyone is at in terms of ability. It was good to get on the same page, and we spent 2+ hours mapping everything out, our high-level to-do's, MVP, our schedule for Friday and over the weekend, and the majority or our stretch goals.

It was nice, our group meshed together quite well, and we just got to work! Rest is history.
