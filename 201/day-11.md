Today was pretty hilarious. I spent a lot of time programming with somebody else, and didn't start until pretty late (2PM) as I wanted a great handle on what to do before I got started in terms of minor steps.

I got up to the point of randomly generating 3 non-repeating numbers per set before leaving around 6, and then getting two consecutive sets to not have any repeating numbers either before going to bed.

I didn't get to the image generation, but felt pretty happy about learning a different way of approaching problems instead of just hacking away at them. I'll be taking this approach to future assignments, as well as not spending as much time explaining things to others until I hit goals/milestones in my own work, so as to make the most out of the time I have with TAs. Only talked to them once, which is much different than my previous trend of getting help from them 5-10 times per day.
