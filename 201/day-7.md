I spent nearly all of today understanding how to do the second portion of yesterdays lab.
I was modeling my work off of a classmate who understood the material and for loops very well, but I realized last night and this morning that I had no functional understanding of for loops and their use cases.
I spent about an hour and a half commenting every single line of his model, until I was able to (while talking to him) explain every line back to him in terms of what it was aiming to accomplish and why.
The model I was examining was also non-functional (he whiteboarded last night for me and a few other students), and was using a few key different naming conventions than my own.
This caused me a lot of problems, both conceptually and functionally, as it was difficult to keep track of everything in my mind.

After I understood the structure in depth, wrote my own version of it and had a lot of trouble due to the changes required from the dated model I had been studying.

The TAs helped me a TON in identifying how to go through and find what wasn't working, and why, and eventually I was able to produce the intended result (printing lists to HTML from the JS) for yesterdays assignment.

Ultimately, I learned that even though it's fine for me to learn from others and adopt what I can understand/manage/modify, I should make sure to slow down with my own code and comment every single line, and avoid writing any code without an understanding of how it will function and affect everything else.
