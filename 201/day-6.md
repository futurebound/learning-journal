WOW.

Today was fun.

Mind bending, but fun. The directions were vague but structured enough to show how to create steps from a somewhat abstract directive.
That directive being: make a page that displays store data to help the guy understand how his stores are performing.

The past assignments, I've always just tried to smash my way through it myself, but today I immediately began talking through the steps with my class neighbor, and then worked back and forth with the most advanced student in our group as he showed us how to combine what I initially thought of as being two separate object literals into one through some pretty complex use of for loops.

I also found how useful it is to utilize the 'this.minCustomer' as opposed to writing out 'pikeStore.minCustomer' simply to keep my code cleaner and easier to read. One in our working group showed us that we could also just reassign properties like the 'pikeStore.minCustomer' to simply 'min' since it was being used multiple times in the following for loop, to positively impact readability.

I didn't complete the second part before leaving, but made sure I had a clear understanding of what needed to be done in terms of taking the JavaScript data and creating functioning HTML lists out of the object literals.
