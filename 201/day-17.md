We got a super base level MVP working! It was mainly just to know that our image rendering was working with HTML IDs and JS for finding those IDs and rendering images within them.

Got all of the questions done as well for a basic MVP, populating properly to every page. The number generation isn't working yet, but should be simple to hook up.

Some more stretch goals in place, and our MVP should be looking/functioning great by tomorrow afternoon with the stretch goal of the number generation instead of just looping through the flashcards in the order which they appear in the array.
