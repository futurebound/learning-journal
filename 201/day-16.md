Well, I think I'm finally starting to understand one of Tim Ferris's tips: if you're learning something, make one thing/page/sheet/file with all the core information all in one place.

He mentioned this with respect to learning Japanese, but explained that the idea could be translated to any subject.

That being said, in compiling topic/question banks for our group project, it's astounding to me how much more sense and how much less resistance there is to study/learn from one single document. It's more than just visual/logical organization for whatever reason, it's as if the mental component takes on that same organization/structure. And, I don't need an internet connection ;]

Working in the group is also very interesting. Moderating tasks and playing to others natural tendencies makes sense at this stage. We haven't really spent much time programming as a group. We've all been doing lots of housekeeping and busy work due to the nature of our project. We have been collaborating and making decisions as a group very well, not moving forward on anything unless the others know what we are and agree with that being what we should do.
