Today was a breathe of fresh air. I worked through the entirety of the chocolate pizza assignment with my partner.

It was pretty fun to pair program on this project, as we both coded different portions and then inevitably had some trouble with merging our forks into the master. We both tried to merge before pulling each others changes onto our local machines, and that created some confusion when going through and fixing merge conflicts.

I learned a TON about the functionality of absolute and relative positioning, and since I hadn't done the CSS Extras assignment last weekend, and was working on JS for my salmon cookies project all week (pretty much no HTML/CSS) this was excellent to do before I got started on those aspects of the project. I feel this exercise with reduce the time I spent on that aspect of the salmon cookie project down to a third of what it would have been if I had worked my way through it before this.
