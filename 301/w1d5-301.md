Realized that I'm falling behind today. This week of afternoon lecture and my resistance to stimulating myself through it has put me in a position where I do not feel confident with the material we covered. 

The code wars assignments are simple and fun, but my jQuery aptitude leaves much to be desired. The assignment format is obviously different than what I was used to (operating from an existing code base) so I am learning that I need to spend more time familiarizing myself with it before I begin working on the TODOs, etc.

I feel alright knowing these things, and how to study/approach the material going forward so we shall see how things progress and I'll start drinking caffeinated tea to be able to better manage the late afternoon/early evening lectures since the material we cover in them is crucial to my conceptual understanding of what we are doing during lab.
