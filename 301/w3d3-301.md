What did I learn about today ..

**IIFEs**
* used to help keep global variables cleaner
* basically a container for a set of functions broken up into smaller categories of functionality. 

**/xxx/:xxx**
* means that anything can be passed and it will respond to it if exists
* pulled from book store as /books/:book_id
* will work for any book_id that can be found

**ctx**
* just shorthand for context

**Handlebars.comepile($('#xxx'));**
* the xxx is always just the target TEMPLATE you're compiling info into 

**=>**
* if you write (x => xxx === xxx) it will return a boolean value
