Chill day, got our groups for project week. Good calibration period to determine where I was really at with the material being covered. Checked in with my team and informed them of how far behind I am relative to those who have kept up, and made contact about getting assistance from them in terms of slack questions, explanations etc. 

Focused on reviewing assignments of this week and completing as many resubmissions as possbile, as well as commented out what I can in this last weeks assignments. This has helped me a lot in the past, to review and understand what is actually going on.

Also had the idea to create an indexed notes with master lists for each topic, including debugging/troubleshooting, things like SQL, CRUD, MVC, etc.

Feeling behind, but not stressing me, lots of avenues to explore/learn.

Also compiling a huge list of highly rated programming books and links to share with other students.
