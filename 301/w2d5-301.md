I learned a lot about SQL today. Lab was pretty tough, and we ran into a few problems with not having dropped our tables from previous labs and that disallowed us from being to inner join tables properly. 

I also learned (or remembered) to RTFM. Missed some very key instructions that cost us a lot of time from the lab README.

We also didn't take the time or simply didn't understand what was happening from a high level. It didn't click for me that we were creating two distinct tables related only by the author_id key, which were to hold author information in one and then article information in the other despite the names of the databases. This caused a bit of confusion in our query selecting, and gave us the same error the entire 4 hours we worked on the lab until it finally went away and everything worked properly when we switched which table we were selecting information from.

Moral of the story, pay attention to assets given up front and check out what's going on from a high level before getting into the nitty gritty.
