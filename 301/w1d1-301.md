What a wonderful feeling to be back!

There's nothing like being completely bamboozled after a long, relaxing, family-centric break. 

Today I mainly learned how to do a bit of housekeeping, installing VSCode as my new editor to explore, and how to transition from one teacher and their respective style to another. 

I also enjoyed the Code Wars kata assignments, and was happy to have spent a bit of time working through many of them over the break.
