Going to start taking handwritten notes and then using these as a place to summarize key learnings from them. Was taking that style of notes last quarter and actually found it very helpful. Most of the things I have time to type in here from lecture are resources that I should just include links to here, as well as summarizing key learnings that for whatever reason only seem to ping me as something I should take note of if I'm using handwritten notes. 

So starting tomorrow we'll give that system a try: 
* LJ with links to lecture repo, resources mentioned, any bookmarks
* Key learnings from handwritten notes
* Summary of the above if needed

As far as today, I understand conceptually what's happening but need to spend a lot of time reviewing the starter code from labs this week, and commenting out what's happening. On a high level I'm fine, but anything involving code gets confusing since I just don't have the exposure to it yet. 

Stressed, but not worried.
