Learning a lot today. Doing better with late lecture now, and understanding on a high level what we're doing and why. Still feel slightly behind but took my final today for my Uni course and will be able to focus solely on this material, which will be a breathe of fresh air.

Didn't take physical notes today, kinda just forgot since it's not a habit. Will continue to do that tomorrow and during this week as long as it's in alignment with the highest good.

Felt fine with Heroku.

Wasn't able to attend the first portion of lecture due to not completing the lab before class because of final, so will be doing a bit of catch up this week and this weekend going into project week resubmitting assignments.
