Today was intense. There was a lot of work to be done to refine everything prior to leaving, and then to add in a quiz feature that had only existed as a stretch goal until this point.

This quiz was a bit more difficult than expected, as it took a bit of help to determine how to get a value of a checked radio button without JQuery. All in all, we finally got our project in presentable condition just after 6PM, and headed home relatively happy with how things played out. I learned a lot about... googling very specific things.
