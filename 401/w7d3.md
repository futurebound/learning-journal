WOoOoOf again.

SO turns out drawing pictures is actually how I begin making conceptual connection with this material. I'm finally starting to understand, so thanks instructors for making so many pretty diagrams.

I actually notice that due to the workload I've just been glossing over the planning phase. I'm just jumping in and then trying to identify what's going wrong and where for literally no reason. It's confusing and disheartening that way. It's little bit late in the game to notice this and modify as the workload will not be decreasing, but I feel this is pretty valuable to understand and take forward regardless. I'll play around with it more for the rest of the course and see if there's less time searching through the a haystack from the get-go.

* I'm skipping likely the most critical part of the process for my learning style.
* I'm tired.
