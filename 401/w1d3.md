Learned a lot today about how I should focus more on the readings. I was confused for over an hour and half on where to begin with todays lab. Low and behold, the second reading the the lecture repo had an entire article dedicated to the exactly fs method we were using for the lab, complete with human readable instructions and explanations that also explained the error callback format we were tasked to utilize.

Specific to that, I learned that the proper format is:

```
fs.readFile('/foo.txt', function(err, data) {
  if(err) {
    console.log('Unknown Error');
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
})
```
