React kind of makes sense. The problems I was having about how to pass around props has been alleviated. Generally able to understand where we do things and why. By **no** means feeling confident overall.

The routing and redirects are actually really interesting. My current confusion is about things like implicit props being passed. For yesterdays lab, I ran into the problem of putting a `<Landing />` component in an anonymous function ternary as opposed to just leaving it as `<xxx exact path='/' component={Landing}>`. It was covered today but I still didn't really understand what was being passed implicitly that wasn't being done in the latter. 

Other confusion is around how things like auth are accessible in some places. Good questions for me to get answered now. Haven't been able to code along during class and ask questions as they arise since the demo code isn't available til afterwards now, so need to keep that in mind and actually check in like this. Thanks LJ.
