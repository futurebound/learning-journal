Whooo! Super behind. 

There's a sort of strange thing happening during lecture that I'm noticing when I got back to watch the lecture videos. For whatever reason, during lecture I'm not making connections with what's being said and where we're at or what it relates to very well. I'm asking questions as they come up, but it's only when I'm rewatching the videos and able to pause/rewind/take notes without losing focus on what's being said that I'm able to make the connections that I feel like I should be. 

This brings into question how I need to adapt my workflow, and I'm going to speak with my instructor about that tomorrow. I'm not freaking out but feeling majorly behind and lost every lab. I will admit I'm seeking out help from the TAs much less than last section,and that is something I just reflected on today and will change immediately.

I'm looking forward to the opportunity to catch up on rewatching lecture videos/taking notes this weekend, as well as getting enough resubmissions in that I'm able to focus on the daily material. It feels like it might be at least through til the beginning of week 4 that I'll be in catch up mode but my intent is to get into a position where I can spend time researching the next day's topics instead of scrambling in the evenings. As mentioned, will be checking in with my instructor tomorrow to figure out what that looks like from their perspective and sync up in that way.
