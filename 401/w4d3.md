Breathing even easier this week. Spent a lot of time going through resubmits and commenting excessively this last weekend, down to under a handful of remaining resubmits from around 10, keeping up conceptually in class and having less questions come up (I hope from a general increase in understanding of material)but still asking as necessary. 

Stuck with the new format for my own work/studyflow that was outlined last week, and it has proved extremely beneficial to stress levels, understanding, everything. Looking forward to project week, as I really am enjoying the server side now that I have a clue what's happening, and am seeing a lot of potential applications for my own personal projects/aspirations with what we're working on right now.

Feeling a little wonky about project week at the same time, mainly b/c myself && group aren't particularly inspired by any amazing idea, and the time is nigh to get something together that we can build a front end for. Likely need to get together with group again and hold another brainstorming session. I've got a lot more mental space cleared out now so that may prove beneficial.

**Learnings**
* Higher level understanding of request-response cycle
* Clearly defined roles of middleware in the application
* Dissapating fear of K_ary trees/data structures in general
* Distinctly aware of need to focus on the data structures, refactor, add to them && practice whiteboarding them (got stumped bigtime with the challenge 1st thing this morning)
* Use of time on bus to work on resubmissions as opposed to doing readings
* Making it work as top priority and meeting that priority before moving on
