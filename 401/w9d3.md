Feeling pretty good. React things kind of just settled in, all the deployment things we're doing make sense and are actually pretty interesting. Loving on Artillery and psyched for Socket.io, as I know that will be extremely useful. Also really excited for project week and to get everything integrated that we've learned so far. They've historically been wonderful for solidifying concepts, and identifying just how useful certain things are to implement and what doesn't really need to be used in a lot of cases.

Feeling good, feeling fine! Enjoying the last bit of time with everyone this week. I'll miss them all && wish them the best.
