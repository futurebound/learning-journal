Today was an excellent reintroduction to jQuery and what I don't understand about it.

I partnered with Melanie for our lab, and overall everything went fairly smooth. Each TODO task was relatively straightforward, and we completed with a little time to spare which was excellent for my sanity.

I'm not finding myself enthralled with afternoon classes, since I am choosing not to stimulate myself awake for the time being and I get a little ansty/mentally drift from 3PM onwards. 

The material is pretty dense, and the biggest problem I'm having is getting used to the new syntax of jQuery and how to utilize all the methods available properly, but I am learning a lot about how to read documentation now and it's becoming much easier to understand than it used to be.
